      <description>In Fall 2018, I decided to apply to be a speaker for TEDxGeorgiaTech. I was chosen as one of the 6 speakers among 70 applicants.
For the 6 weeks that followed, I rewrote my speech several times over, memorized for hours at a time, and struggled to master hand gestures and vocal intonations.
Finally, on November 4th, 2018, my hard would paid. I was chosen to be the speaker that closed out the show.</description>

      <description>Background: From June 2017 to June 2018, I worked as a Full-Time Software Engineer. I was all set to leave work at the end of the summer and return to Georgia Tech as a full-time Master&amp;rsquo;s Student for the Fall 2018 semester, but I suddenly got offered this unique opportunity by Duke TIP to teaching high schoolers Programming and AI. I jumped at the opportunity. Friday June 22nd, 2018 was my last day as an engineer, and Saturday morning on June 23rd I was already flying out to Houson for Rice University.</description>
