&lt;p&gt;I was enrolled in a seminar course titled &lt;em&gt;Learning with Limited Supervision&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Fall 2019&lt;/em&gt;, and each class a group of students would lead a discussion on a chosen paper. For my discussion, I chose the &lt;a href=&#34;http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Ian Goodfellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tasked with not only presenting the methodology, but also debating the strengths of the paper against my colleague who presented the paper&#39;s weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the paper being a seminal work in Computer Vision and in Deep Learning, there was plenty to discuss about the ideas presented in this paper since a few years have passed since its publishing, which allows us to look back and reflect on how these ideas have held up over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
