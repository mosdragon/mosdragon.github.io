      <description>In Fall 2018, I decided to apply to be a speaker for TEDxGeorgiaTech&amp;rsquo;s Fall speaker salon. I was chosen as one of the 6 speakers among 70 applicants.
For the 6 weeks that followed, I rewrote my speech several times over. I changed it drastically from what it started off as, added entirely new ideas, and overall realized that the focus of the talk had to be not my experience, but rather what others should take from it.</description>
