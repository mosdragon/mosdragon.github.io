      <description>In Fall 2018, I decided to apply to be a speaker for TEDxGeorgiaTech. I was chosen as one of the 6 speakers among 70 applicants.
For the 6 weeks that followed, I rewrote my speech several times over, memorized for hours at a time, and struggled to master hand gestures and vocal intonations.
Finally, on November 4th, 2018, my hard would paid. I was chosen to be the speaker that closed out the show.</description>
