      <description>Background: Graph Theory was among my favorite topics during my Undergraduate Algorithms course, and in Fall 2016, I managed to find research that would build on my interests in that area as well as leverage the Systems background I had (from one of concentration areas: Devices).
I joined Dr. Oded Green that term, and we began work immediately on Streaming Graphs (also known as Dynamic Graphs). These are graphs where the Nodes $V$ and Edges $E$ change over time.</description>
