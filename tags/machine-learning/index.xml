      <description>Background: From June 2017 to June 2018, I worked as a Full-Time Software Engineer. I was all set to leave work at the end of the summer and return to Georgia Tech as a full-time Master&amp;rsquo;s Student for the Fall 2018 semester, but I suddenly got offered this unique opportunity by Duke TIP to teaching high schoolers Programming and AI. I jumped at the opportunity. Friday June 22nd, 2018 was my last day as an engineer, and Saturday morning on June 23rd I was already flying out to Houson for Rice University.</description>
