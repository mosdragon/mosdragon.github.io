      <title>Speaking at TEDxGeorgiaTech&#39;s Fall 2018 Speaker Salon</title>
      <link>http://sakhi.es/post/ted/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2018, I decided to apply to be a speaker for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tedxgeorgiatech.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TEDxGeorgiaTech&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Fall speaker salon. I was chosen as one of the 6 speakers among 70 applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 6 weeks that followed, I rewrote my speech several times over. I changed it drastically from what it started off as, added entirely new ideas, and overall realized that the focus of the talk had to be not my experience, but rather what others should take from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on November 4th, 2018, my hard work paid off. I was the final speaker for the night, so I ended the show. My talk, &lt;em&gt;Compounding Interest: How Instilling Drive Goes a Long Way&lt;/em&gt; tried to strike a delicate balance between being informative and being relatable. My focus was on the importance of instilling drive and the cascading effect that it had on educating society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find my full talk &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0mim3S6ASk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I found out in February, 2019 that I have been chosen among the 6 speakers from last Fall to speak again at the TedXGeorgiaTech Conference held on April 13th, 2019. I&amp;rsquo;m psyched about the chance to revise my talk and give it one more time in front of an even larger crowd!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SUMO Challenge</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2018, I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://cs.brown.edu/people/zr1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zhile Ren&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SUMO Challenge&lt;/a&gt; by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SUMO Challenge has several tracks for which we can compete for the best results, so our team decided to compete for the 3D Bounding Box track. That is, given 360 Degree RGB-Depth images, can we determine the 3D oriented bounding box for each of the items in the given scene?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 100 included object categories, with a pretty skewed distribution:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/category_stats.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sumo Categories&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;approaches&#34;&gt;Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, Zhile and I were determined to use direct 3D detection approaches like using &lt;a href=&#34;http://cs.brown.edu/people/zr1/publications/cvpr2016/cvpr2016.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clouds of Oriented Gradients (CoG)&lt;/a&gt;. However, the enormous size of the dataset (1+ Terrabyte) and image sizes (&lt;code&gt;1024 x 6144 x 3 channels&lt;/code&gt;) immediately became problematic, both for training and inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CoGs are great when the shape of the categories are easy to discern (i.e shapes that are not predominantly &amp;ldquo;box-like&amp;rdquo;), but in SUMO, we had many items that would have taken on very similar CoGs such as &lt;code&gt;single_bed&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;double_bed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tv_stand&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;dresser&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided a good starting point would be to determine object locations in the 2D space, and see where we could go from there. We intended to then train for CoGs, but we had limited time with the SUMO challenge deadline being mid-December, so we decided to see how well we could perform by using the following pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 3D bounding boxes into 2D space to generate a 2D dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train a Faster-R-CNN network to detect objects on the 2D dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project the 2D coordinates back into 3D, do some simple post-processing to prevent things like walls and floors from being in the bounding box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train Regressors to help correct the coordinates on a per-category basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 18th, we found out that the SUMO challege deadline would be pushed back to January 14th. We continued work on step &lt;code&gt;(3)&lt;/code&gt; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far in step &lt;code&gt;(4)&lt;/code&gt;, so our final pipeline consists of steps &lt;code&gt;(1)&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;(3)&lt;/code&gt;. We made our submission on Sunday, January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found out that we were narrowly beat by the Princeton Vision Lab for 1st place, leaving us in 2nd place for our cateogry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-results-in-3d&#34;&gt;Visual Results in 3D&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are our results in the 3D space. On the left, we have a red bounding box, which is our detection. On the right in green we have the ground truth bounding boxes for that same scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/sumo_tv.png&#34; alt=&#34;Detection of a television  with books in the tv stand&#34; /&gt;
&lt;center&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Detection of a &lt;code&gt;television&lt;/code&gt;  with &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; in the tv stand. &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/sumo_shower.png&#34; alt=&#34;Detection of a shower&#34; /&gt;
&lt;center&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Detection of a &lt;code&gt;shower&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/sumo_door.png&#34; alt=&#34;Detection of a door&#34; /&gt;
&lt;center&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Detection of a &lt;code&gt;door&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-results-in-2d&#34;&gt;Visual Results in 2D&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some visual results we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in the 2D space training the Faster-R-CNN network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/one.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scene 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/two.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scene 2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/three.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scene 3&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/four.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scene 4&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://sakhi.es/img/sumo/five.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scene 5&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the network performs fairly well. Mean AP was about &lt;code&gt;23%&lt;/code&gt; which is reasonable given the enormous dataset size and the skewed distribution. One aspect that particularly complicates this challenge are the walls and floors, which are object categories, but the coordinates are often outside of single-frame views, which is exactly what this network was trained to perform on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Betweenness Centrality for Streaming Graphs</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Graph Theory&lt;/a&gt; was among my favorite topics during my Undergraduate Algorithms course, and in Fall 2016, I managed to find research that would build on my interests in that area as well as leverage the Systems background I had (from one of concentration areas: &lt;em&gt;Devices&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ogreen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Oded Green&lt;/a&gt; that term, and we began work immediately on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_connectivity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Streaming Graphs&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Dynamic Graphs). These are graphs where the Nodes $V$ and Edges $E$ change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-betweenness-centrality-on-streaming-graphs&#34;&gt;Problem: Betweenness Centrality on Streaming Graphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Betweenness Centrality&lt;/a&gt;(BC) is a measure of a node&amp;rsquo;s centrality in a graph based on it&amp;rsquo;s presence in shortest paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the &lt;em&gt;hub&lt;/em&gt; that connects many different transportation lines. The more dependent other transportation lines are on a given &lt;em&gt;hub&lt;/em&gt;, the more central that &lt;em&gt;hub&lt;/em&gt; is to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a static graph, we can compute the BC values for each node pretty easily (in terms of time complexity). However, real-world graphs like Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Social Network Graph contain hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. If we wanted up-to-date BC values for graphs of this scale, re-computing BC each time a node/edge is &lt;em&gt;inserted&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; becomes infeasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s our task: Given a graph and then a sequence of insertions/deletions, can we accurately compute the BC values without recomputing on the entire graph?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;approach&#34;&gt;Approach:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a framework called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cuStinger/cuStinger&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cuStinger&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;em&gt;portmanteau&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Cuda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stinger&lt;/em&gt;), which served as the backbone of our adventure in getting Streaming BC going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this framework (which saved us largely from writing repetitive Cuda code), we implemented the algorithm as described &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C_7l2roAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en#d=gs_md_cita-d&amp;amp;p=&amp;amp;u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DC_7l2roAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DC_7l2roAAAAJ%3A9yKSN-GCB0IC%26tzom%3D300&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were using Nvidia GPUs and Cuda under the hood, we had various challenges with race conditions, mutex locks, and validating results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of that year, we managed to have a running version that handled &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; edge cases of streaming graphs. There were some we hadn&amp;rsquo;t implemented yet when I left the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, the lab moved onto a new framework (developed in-house with Oded and his lab), &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hornet-gt/hornet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hornet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallel Computation comes with some challenges, be ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advances in GPU programming are opening doors to many new areas ripe for exploration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ALWAYS write tests to validate results (we compared our Streaming BC results to our Static BC at each insertion/deletion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tools-used&#34;&gt;Tools Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cuda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cuStinger framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Leaving My Comfort Zone: 4 Weeks Teaching High Schoolers</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June 2017 to June 2018, I worked as a Full-Time Software Engineer. I was all set to leave work at the end of the summer and return to Georgia Tech as a full-time Master&amp;rsquo;s Student for the Fall 2018 semester, but I suddenly got offered this unique opportunity by &lt;a href=&#34;https://tip.duke.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Duke TIP&lt;/a&gt; to teaching high schoolers Programming and AI. I &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt; at the opportunity. Friday June 22nd, 2018 was my last day as an engineer, and Saturday morning on June 23rd I was already flying out to Houson for Rice University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next four weeks, I taught 2 classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies/courses/applications-algorithms-computers-modern-programming-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Applications, Algorithms, Computers: Modern Programming&lt;/a&gt; @ Rice University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies/courses/artificial-intelligence-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; @ Georgia Tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-i&#34;&gt;Phase I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first class, I was a temp hire &amp;ndash; I was only there for the final week, since the previous instructor for the course was unable to teach that final week of the program. So, I was responsible for making sure these 18 students understood Python well enough that in just 5 days, I could teach them the basics of Web Development, and by the end of the week, each student would have used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://flask.pocoo.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; framework to make a really simple Twitter clone. Despite my limited time with the students, this was an overwhelming success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The true hero was my Teaching Assistant, Noah Spiner&lt;/strong&gt;, who held the class together all three weeks and made my transition into the classroom with these new kids a smooth one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 7 days after my arrival there, it was time to say goodbye. I had parent-teacher conferences with each of my students&amp;rsquo; parents. It was a wonderful experience &amp;ndash; my students genuinely felt that I&amp;rsquo;d impacted them in that short 1-week we were here together, and parents loved how I&amp;rsquo;d manaded to inspire their kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-ii&#34;&gt;Phase II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the teaching experience I was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; psyched about &amp;ndash; the chance to teach high schoolers AI! I was tasked with crafting the curriculum end-to-end, including crafting syllabi, conducting lectures, creating assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see my syllabus &lt;a href=&#34;http://sakhi.es/files/syllabus.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It offered a mix of the serious topics (Fundamentals of Python, Graph Search, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing) and fun games and activities the class really enjoyed (Bot or Not?, Jeopardy Review sessions, AI Rap Battle, Robotics Lab Field Trip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three whole weeks somehow flew by, and I could see from the looks on my students&amp;rsquo; faces that they felt the impact of my teaching. This was worth it all. This was worth the additional 2-3 hours I&amp;rsquo;d spend nightly preparing material for the next day, this was worth having to overcome my fear of standing in front of crowds, and this was definitely worth forgoing the additional month of full-time work experience I could&amp;rsquo;ve had instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some links to resources I wrote / used for the AI course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sakhi.es/files/syllabus.pdf&#34;&gt;Syllabus for AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mosdragon/teach_ml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Repository for AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mosdragon/teach_ml/blob/master/machine_learning_walkthrough.ipynb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Machine Learning Experiment Walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mosdragon/teach_ml/blob/master/cross_validation_tutorial.ipynb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cross-Validation Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mosdragon/teach_ml/blob/master/regression_tutorial.ipynb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Regression Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these assignments I created by following through tutorials available from others and adapting them to what my class was able to handle. At the moment, I don&amp;rsquo;t have links to all those that helped, but I will try to add them when I get a chance to go back through my notes from the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also could not have had such a phenomenal experience without the help of my &lt;strong&gt;Teaching Assistant for AI, Julian Wright&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
